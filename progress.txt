2026-01-29 - CH-1: Auto-save conversation after each exchange

COMPLETED:
- Modified Dialog.tsx to persist conversations to chrome.storage.local
- Conversations auto-save after each assistant response (streamEnd event)
- Auto-generates conversation title from first user message (truncated to 50 chars)
- Generates UUID for new conversations using crypto.randomUUID()
- Burn button (🔥) now deletes conversation from storage (not just clears state)
- Conversation ID resets when provider changes or conversation cleared

FILES CHANGED:
- src/content/components/Dialog.tsx

NOTES FOR NEXT PERSON:
- CH-1 implemented (auto-save works), but history PANEL UI (CH-2) not yet built
- Conversations save to storage but no way to VIEW history list yet
- CH-7 (burn button) is functionally complete but can't be verified without history panel
- Storage infrastructure already exists for conversations (Storage.getConversations, etc)
- Next priority: CH-2 (history panel accessible from dialog header) to make saved convos visible
